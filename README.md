- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jacobstpierre

Iâ€™m interested in the many applications and uses of data analytics and data science. After completing my B.Comm from The University of Guelph in 2015, I've begun learning 
the skills, techniques, and tools for a career in data analytics. I've completed IBM's Data Analytics Certification on Coursera, and 
am currently working through the Google Certificion as well. On top of this I'm completing the Certificate in Big Data Anlytics from York University. I'm using this Github
page to display projects I've completed in my spare time, as well as projects from York U. I'm currently working on hoing my Python skills and apply what I know to using 
machine learning models.
